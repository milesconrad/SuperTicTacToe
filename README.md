# SuperTicTacToe

This is a game I made as part of my CIS 163 Computer Science II course at Grand Valley State University. The goal of the project was to create a version of Tic-Tac-Toe in which the size of the board could be chosen upon starting the game. However, despite what you may expect, 3 in a row is all that is needed to win, not a full row/column/diagonal. A simple game AI was required to allow singleplayer, as well as an undo button which allowed you to go all the way back to the beginning of the game.
